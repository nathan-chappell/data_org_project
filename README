Data Organization Project.

Here is an implementation of a Btree, and hash tables utilizing hash
schemes of Larson and Kalja, and Fagin.

All of the structures are implemented with the intention that they will be
used with a "storage_model" (see include/storage_model.h).  The idea is
that the storage_model represents secondary storage, and the structures
interface with it to read and write data.

The program has been written, but not checked for correctness.

The program needs to have a "page-cache" implemented for the implementation
to make sense.  Basically, the "reference managers" need to put a counter
into iterators to make sure that pages aren't released while being
accessed...
